# A  genetic algorithm for topology optimization of area-to-point heat conduction problem

This repo contains the codes used in the following paper entitled: [A genetic algorithm for topology optimization of area-to-point heat conduction problem, by R. Boichot, Y. Fan - International Journal of Thermal Sciences, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2016.05.015).

This code is intended to solve the area-to-point topology problem in thermal science with a global optimization algorithm, more precisely a genetic algorithm. The code initially generates a massive population of random topology candidates for cooling a heated surface. From generations to generations, following the principle of the Evolution of Species theorized by Charles Darwin, better shapes are selected, mutated, crossed, while average shapes are progressively discarded. The code is extrememy hungry for calculation power. It is meant to be used with the [Parallel computing toolbox of Matlab](https://fr.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html) on multi-core processors. The code itself solves a Finite Difference approximation of the heat equation on unspecified shapes with a direct sparse solver. The test case converges in about one day on a desktop computer with 8 cores.

Using the code is simple: fill the parameters in the [main code](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/A-genetic-algorithm-for-topology-optimization-of-area-to-point-heat-conduction-problem/blob/main/Codes/Algo_genetique_random_start.m) and choose the [objective function](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/A-genetic-algorithm-for-topology-optimization-of-area-to-point-heat-conduction-problem/blob/77b30eec27d34e6d38e9647b3e93b31041f035ac/Codes/Algo_genetique_random_start.m#L90). Run the code and enjoy emerging shapes !

The code can natively minimize:
- (1) the distance from the maximum temperature element to the heat sink;
- (2) the maximum temperature of the domain;
- (3) the entropy generated by the structure;
- (4) the standard deviation of temperatures over the domain;
- (5) the standard deviation of temperature gradients over the domain;
- (6) the standard deviation of temperatures along the adiabatic border of the domain;
- (7) the average temperature;

Proof by the absurd shows that (2) and (6) are strictly equivalent. Counter intuitively, minimizing entropy (3) over the domain gives very poorly performing shapes as the definition of entropy favored high temperatures to decrease entropy. Objective functions (4) and (5) gives very artistic shapes. The codes also leads to non intuitive (but optimal) situations where the conductive matter is repulsed from the heatsink if it is not conductive enough.

# Epilogue

It has been proven by some brilliant team since that [global optima for this problem are fibrous non branched topologies](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.01.114) (which is rather intuitive, branching always increases thermal resistance as the shortest path to the heat sink is to not pass by a branch). However in terms of thermal performances, the sub-optimal topologies found by this code are very close to the global optimum. Due to their discrete aspect, they are moreover easier to fabricate. Anyway, I was beaten by people much more clever than me !
